# Online Git & CodiTech

As you have learned previously with Git basic 01, you can create a local directory to keep track of your changes.
But what if you want to work in team or remotely ?

Several solutions exist. The most common and free to use are Github and Gitlab.

You can research more about Github vs Gitlab. 

Here are some links :
* [Gitlab (Github Vs Gitlab)](https://about.gitlab.com/devops-tools/github-vs-gitlab.html)
* [Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/github-vs-gitlab-which-is-better-for-open-source-projects-31c45d464be0)
* [Google](https://www.google.com)

Keep in mind that online platforms such as Github and GitLab still use the Git system. You will **not** work directly on the website. You will **keep** working with command lines that you have seen in  [Git basic 01](./git-basics-01.md).
But instead of **push** your change locally, you will **push** them online so you or someone else can view/retrieve them easily.

> During your **Codi training** you will use Github. Why ? Because Github provides us with certain solutions such as Gitbook and bigger exposure on the internet for potential employers.

## Online Git Concept & Important Terms
Online Git provides us with plenty of new tools and commands. Some of them are more important than others, in our case we will learn 4 of them. It should be enough to get you started.

#### Essential Git Commands
1. CLONE : This is how you get the files on your computer by downloading the online repository to your local machine. 
2. PULL : Sometime your local folder is not up to date. Git pull will grab all the recent changes and update it for you. You can't pull if there is active changes that has not been staged.
3. FORK : With any online version control manager you have the ability to 'copy' a repository to your own personal space we call this a 'fork'. So you can work on it on your own or with your team, without altering the original repository files.
4. MERGE : Merge & Pull Request. They are the root of team sharing. When you or your collaborator will do a change on his repository or branch and you may request to update the changes you have made. 
> Merge can have conflicts. For instance if the same file is edited twice by two different person git will ask you to verify and edit the changes manually.

#### Local vs Online 
The difference between online and local git is that you are **not** going to use **.git init**. Instead clone will bind your folder to the online repository.

#### Repositories
We call online folder/files storage "repository or repo". A Repository is a Data Structure that holds everything your project contains e.g. : files, commits, *branches...

Repositories can have private or public access. By being private a repository won't appear anywhere else other than your personal space.
A public repository will be visible to everyone.

> ! A public repository can't be modified by a non collaborator user. However, he will be able to clone/fork and do merge requests.

What is a branch ?

A branch is an entry point in the data structure of Git. It allows the system to retrieve the data you requested, The same way you call someone by his name. A Branch is identified by its name. 

A branch is created under the name of "master" by default when you create a repository. You can create as many branches as you want within the same repository.

> In the process of cloning. The master branch is the default target. You will learn how to clone from another branch later on.

------
Now that you know a bit more about Git. We will introduce Coditech and how general exercises are submitted. 

n.b: Some of the concepts we talked about earlier are not applied here but no worries! We have prepared an exercise for you!

## CodiTech
At Codi we have our own organization hosted on github : [CodiTech](www.github.com/coditech)

It contains multiple repositories. These are the main ones :
* Documentation 
> This is for Gitbook. All of the documentation files are hosted there. You will not need to **fork** this.
* Submission Folder
> This will be the main repository for your exercises and challenges.
* Team Projects (e.g. Prefab-Houses)
> Certain team projects will require you to **fork** additional repositories. Team projects are some of them.

What is fork ? [Secret](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)

## Setup 
#### Github
1. Lets create a [Github Account](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)
> Fill the form and don't forget to add a picture so we can recognize each other =)
2. Visit Coditech [CodiTech](https://github.com/coditech)
> Great ! You can now navigate threw the different repositories of coditech. **don't close the tab**
3. (Optional) Join the Codi tech Organization !
> **If the join button does not appear then please send us your github nickname on discord**

Good you're all set !

## Submission Repository
During prairie you will have to do some exercises to get keys. These exercises will have to be pushed in a submission folder.
The [Submission Repository](https://github.com/coditech/Submissions) is present in Coditech Github. 

1. It's time to fork it! We will use the graphical interface for that.
Get to the Submission repository and lets fork it to our own repository space.
![](./Assets/git_02_fork_instruction.PNG)
 1. Click on the Fork button and let github do the job for you.
> Done ? You should now see it in your repository's list. Github redirects you automatically to it. If you have trouble finding it, you can use this url https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/Submissions *don't forget to edit **YOUR USER NAME**.
2. Great ! We will clone into our computer now. There are different clone protocols (HTTPS & SSH). For now we will use the simple https protocol.
![](./Assets/git_02_clone_instruction_01.PNG)
 1. Click on the green button "Clone or download" and copy the link provided.
 2. Open your terminal and move to Desktop. This is where the repository will be downloaded
 3. Write the following command to clone
```sh
    $(username): git clone **paste your link (ctrl + shift + v)**
```
> By default the clone command will create a folder named like your online repository, in our case it will be **Submission**. You can override this by adding an additional argument in the command line as follows.
```sh
    $(username): git clone **paste your link (ctrl + shift + v)** YOURFOLDERNAME
```
  4. Done ? We are set ! Just one more thing...

> You can download manually a repository without cloning but this will not include the .git files

#### Submission Repository Updates
*!! Submission folder might recieve updates at any time !!*

In order to keep our Submission Folder Updated with the Coditech Repository we will add a Remote access to our local git.
Follow the steps in order to add a remote access to coditech.

1. Locate Submission Folder on your computer (the one you cloned previously).
2. Open your terminal/(Konsole *arch*)  (within the Submission Folder) 
3. Write the command and verify you have no active changes. 
```sh git status``` 

> *If you have active change, Commit and Push before next steps*

4. Still in your terminal (within the submission folder) write the following command

```sh
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/coditech/Submissions.git
```

> With git Remote we say to our git system to locate coditech/submission repository and add it as 'upstream'

5. Verify if the Remote is correctly added

```sh
  git remote -v
```

You should now see the following output :

```sh
  origin  https://github.com/github_username/submissions.git (fetch)
  origin  https://github.com/github_username/submissions.git (push)
  upstream        https://github.com/coditech/Submissions.git (fetch)
  upstream        https://github.com/coditech/Submissions.git (push)
```

As you can see 'origin' is pointing to your own github account while 'upstream' is pointing to coditech. Perfect...

6. We will now update our local repository. for this you will need two command. Run the following in your terminal (within your submission folder)

```sh
  git fetch upstream
  git pull upstream master
```

> git fetch will simply verify that your repository is able to recieve updates from the upstream (coditech).

> git pull will get all the new files from coditech and update your local repository.

7. Update your github Repository. You will simply perform a standard commit/push.
```sh
git add -A
git commit -m "Sync Coditech / Submission master"
git push origin master
```

Voil√†, Your set !

Note : Next time you will need to update your repository simply redo the steps 3, 6 and 7.

## Git Software Manager
Git system is huge and it can be tiresome when you have to deal with problems. Fortunately there are many alternative solutions to command lines and we call them Git Managers.

Fortunately for us we won't have to use any of those. Instead we have Visual Studio Code. VS Code has an integrated Git manager. I recommend watching this video to know more about it. [VSCode Tutorials #4 - Git Integration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n1G45kpU2o)
